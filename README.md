# Brautomat ESP32 platformIO build

Brautomat32 V 1.47 platformIO espressif Arduino Core 3.1.0 IDF v5.3 (pioarduino)

Brautomat 1.47+ expands the range of functions with a second induction hob GGM IDS. If you want you can use up to three kettles:

- brew kettle, first induction hob GGM IDS
- mash tun, the new second induction hob GGM IDS
- hot liquid tank (sparge water)

1th note: contrary to the manual below special funktions do not need to have a temperature and a time set to zero anymore. Now you can use special functions to start your hlt with a setpoint or a mash rests on your second induction hob.

2nd note: Brautomat32 1.47 platformIO is an early beta.

3rd note: have fun and send feedback

_pIO versions are not compatible with Brautomat32: you can not upgrade from brautomat32 to brautomat32 pIO due to different partition layout. Use backup & restore for your configuration!_
